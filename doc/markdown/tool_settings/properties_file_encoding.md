# Encoding setting for properties file

The default encoding of the properties file is ISO-8859-1, which is inconvenient for use with Japanese.

shirates-core's properties file supports UTF-8, we recommend changing the IntelliJ IDEA settings to use it.

### Recommended setting

1. `IntelliJ IDEA > Preferences` (or `File > Settings`)
2. `Editor > File Encodings`
3. Set `Default encoding for properties file:` to **UTF-8**
4. Click `OK` .
