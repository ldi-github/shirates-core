    <h1>Causes of flaky test</h1>
    <p>Some time you can see that running the test that passed before fails this time, and after rerunning the test the problem is resolved. This means the test is not reliable.</p>
    <p>There are many causes of flaky test.</p>
    <h2>Order dependent tests</h2>
    <p>Order dependent tests may be efficient in time on running in serial but may fail on running in parallel.</p>
    <p>Write order-independent test as possible as you can if you want to run tests in parallel, or to rerun only failed test.</p>
    <h2>Stale element error</h2>
    <p>Sync screen elements between device and local cache. <strong>shirates-core</strong>â€™s built in syncing mechanism supports syncing as possible as it can.</p>
    <h2>Session corruption</h2>
    <p>Appium server session may be corrupted on launching app/terminating app/restarting device and so on. Session corruption causes many kinds of error.</p>
    <p>Consider reconnecting to appium server.</p>
    <h2>Poor quality of Virtual device</h2>
    <p>Virtual devices(Android emulator/iOS simulator) is often not stable.</p>
    <p>Consider rebooting the device on trouble.</p>
    <h2>High CPU/IO load</h2>
    <p>High CPU/IO load leads processes to time out error. Parallel-testing using many virtual devices may cause this problem.</p>
    <p>Consider avoiding high loads. Booting virtual device consume resources intensively, so starting up virtual devices in serial with interval is a good practice.</p>
