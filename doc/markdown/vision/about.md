# What is Shirates/Vision?

Shirates/Vision is Computer Vision(CV) driven mobile testing framework powered by Vision Framework on macOS.<br>

### True multi-platform

You can run tests on every application platform on Android and iOS because of CV driven.

- Android native
- iOS native
- Flutter
- Compose Multiplatform
- etc

### Key technologies

- AI-OCR for text recognition
- Image classification/matching by machine learning

### **Intuitive API and easy configuration**<br>

- Manipulating and verifying mobile apps without cumbersome configuration (like `[Screen Name].json` in
  Shirates/Classic).
- All you have to do is capturing screenshots(screens, icons) into directories, write test codes using the image, and
  run tests.

### Improved performance especially on iOS<br>

Computer vision driven API bypasses accessing DOM (This process is very slow especially for iOS). The performance of
Shirates/Vision has been improved on iOS dramatically over the former version(Shirates/Classic).

### Shirates/Classic

[**Shirates/Classic**](classic/index.md) is an older version of Shirates, previously simply Shirates. It is a
traditional method testing framework with DOM access using appium.
**Shirates/Vision** is a newer version of Shirates.
